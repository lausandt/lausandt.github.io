    <p>This blog is mostly about my opinions in programming. Opinions like: Haskell is the best programming language, yet I prefer to write code in Python. Why? Simply because the Python ecosystem is far superior to Haskell's and, in fact, any programming language I know, with maybe the exception of Java. At university I was trained in Java and put off it forever, well ever ever?</p>
<p>I find Java too verbose as a language. I find the OO paradigm adds many many layers of verbosity, many of which I see as obsolete. I prefer the simplicity and elegance of the functional paradigm, although granted that simplicity is not always as easy implemented as one wants. Finally, I am, like most programmers, quite in awe of Rust.</p>
<p>Outside programming, I am very interested in mathematics, category theory, of course those interested in Haskell will think, but also linear algebra and logic. So I might just write some bloggy stuff about that too.</p>
<p>Finally, I am very interested in cooking and wine, but I am not sure a GitHub page is the right platform for opinions about food or wine. Well, just quickly, I should express the opinion that Bordeaux wines are grossly overpriced and that Spain and especially Portugal offer a much better price-quality range. </p>
<p>Opinions, opinions, and more opinions. Opinions are subject to change, so if you do not agree with an opinion expressed, go to the contact page and send me an email.</p>
