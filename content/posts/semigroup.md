Summary: A quick peek at semigroup and monoids.

A semigroup, the basis of a monoid, is a set with an associative binary operation on it. A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element. Both are algebraic structures that appear in many branches of mathematics. For instance in Category Theory we might consider a monoid to be a category with only one object. All morphisms from that object go to itself.
