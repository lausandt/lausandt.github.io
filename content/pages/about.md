Title: about 

This blog is mostly about my opinions in programming. Opinions like: Haskell is the best programming language, yet I prefer to write code in Python. Why? Simply because the Python ecosystem is far superior to Haskell's and, in fact, any programming language I know, with maybe the exception of Java. At university I was trained in Java and put off it forever, well ever ever?

I find Java too verbose as a language. I find the OO paradigm adds many many layers of verbosity, many of which I see as obsolete. I prefer the simplicity and elegance of the functional paradigm, although granted that simplicity is not always as easy implemented as one wants. Finally, I am, like most programmers, quite in awe of Rust.

Outside programming, I am very interested in mathematics, category theory, of course those interested in Haskell will think, but also linear algebra and logic. So I might just write some bloggy stuff about that too.

Finally, I am very interested in cooking and wine, but I am not sure a GitHub page is the right platform for opinions about food or wine. Well, just quickly, I should express the opinion that Bordeaux wines are grossly overpriced and that Spain and especially Portugal offer a much better price-quality range. 

Opinions, opinions, and more opinions. Opinions are subject to change, so if you do not agree with an opinion expressed, go to the contact page and send me an email.
